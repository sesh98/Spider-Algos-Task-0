# A personal description 
I'm Seshasayi, a sophomore studying in one of the better known universities in India-**National Institute of Technology,Trichy**.
I'm pursuing my Btech in ECE, although it wasnt the major of first choice. I preoccupy myself with a couple of activities when im free 
or when i feel that academics has become too mundane.Some of them worth mentioning are
* Tennis
* Violin
* Gaming

My topics of interest include *Artificial Intelligence* and *Cryptography*.I feel that Artificial Intelligence is the future and we are 
making swift progress towards making this world a highly functional environmnent. 

I have two self driven motives 
>To be unique in whatever i do.

>To leave an impact on the world in some way or the other
